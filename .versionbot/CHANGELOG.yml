                On transitioning from the initramfs to the rootfs, the udev
                database is

                cleanedup as the rules between initramfs and rootfs might defer.


                However, dm devices are flagged not to be re-processed, so we need to

                set a sticky bit on them so they persist the cleanup.

                This is needed because the rules in the final rootfs might be

                different than the one in the initramfs.


                Devices that need to persist, like dm devices, need to be flagged with

                the `db_persist` option.

                From v2.49, the hostapp-update utility creates the /run
                directory in the

                root filesystem, however when huping from previous versions /run is not

                there.


                Commit bab3cd7f50022127bfef50fde9cd445b6b55a7b2 switches to use /tmp

                to store the new UUID for the root partition on first boot after

                generating new UUIDs as this is backwards compatible.


                However, this means that the udev database in the initramfs is recreated

                on the final system instead of reused. This becomes a problems for DM

                devices (used in luks based disk encryption), as they are not re-processed

                by udevd.


                This change will use /run if available, so new releases that may implement

                disk encryption work, or /tmp if not so it still remains backwards

                compatible for HUP from older releases.

                Some BIOS configuration, like TianoCore used in QEMU, needs DER
                keys for

                secure boot setup. Also, der, auth and esl keys are served base64 encoded

                and need to be decoded before they can be used.
